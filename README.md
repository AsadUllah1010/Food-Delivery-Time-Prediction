# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
Food Delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy need to show the accurate time it will take to deliver your order to keep transparency with their customers. These companies use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the food delivery time based on how much time the delivery partners took for the same distance in the past.
# Introduction
To predict the food delivery time in real-time, we need to calculate the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food consumption. After finding the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations, we need to find relationships between the time taken by delivery partners to deliver the food in the past for the same distance. So, for this task, we need a dataset containing data about the time taken by delivery partners to deliver food from the restaurant to the delivery location.
# Conclusion
The dataset doesnâ€™t have any feature that shows the difference between the restaurant and the delivery location. All we have are the latitude and longitude points of the restaurant and the delivery location. We can use the haversine formula to calculate the distance between two locations based on their latitudes and longitudes. o the features that contribute most to the food delivery time based on our analysis are:
1. age of the delivery partner
2. ratings of the delivery partner
3. distance between the restaurant and the delivery location
